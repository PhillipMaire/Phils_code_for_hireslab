%% Upslope Area Toolbox Features
%
% The Upslope Area Toolbox includes tools that can:
%
% * Compute the upslope area for every location in a DEM.
% * Compute the downhill water drainage region (influence map) for a given
% location in a DEM.
% * Compute the uphill water drainage region (dependence map) for a given
% location in a DEM.
% * Fill interior sinks in a DEM.
% * Visualize upslope area, influence maps, and dependence maps superimposed on
% the original DEM.
% * Identify fill values connected to the edges of a DEM.
